# Humangehalt™

**Humangehalt** describes the percentage share of *human authorship* in a work.

It is a concise term for expressing how much thinking, decision-making, writing/creating, and responsibility genuinely came from a human — as opposed to being generated or shaped by automated systems such as AI.

Humangehalt is a **self-assessment**, not a measurement, certification, or quality seal.
