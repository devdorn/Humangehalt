# Humangehalt™

![Humangehalt](humangehalt.svg)

**Humangehalt** is a concise term for the share of **human authorship** in a work.

It expresses how much thinking, decision-making, writing/creating, and responsibility genuinely came from a person — as opposed to being generated or shaped by automated systems such as AI.

Humangehalt is a **self-assessment**, not a measurement, certification, or quality seal.

## The notation

### Concept mark

`H/` represents the concept *Humangehalt* itself and may be used without a numeric value.

### Notation with value

A numeric value is optional and expresses the author’s **self-assessed share of human authorship** at the time of publication.

- The value is informational, not evaluative  
- No percent sign is used in the mark  
- No external verification is implied  

The number may change over time as a work evolves.

## What Humangehalt expresses

Humangehalt refers to the parts of a work that are genuinely attributable to human authorship, such as:

- intention and direction  
- selection and rejection  
- framing and editing decisions  
- coherence and responsibility for the result  

AI assistance may have been used, but **does not count toward the Humangehalt**.

Humangehalt can be applied to texts, software, documentation, images, audio, video, or mixed works — for example in websites, repositories, README files, or publications.

## What Humangehalt is not

Humangehalt is **not**:

- an objective measurement  
- an automated detection result  
- a third-party review  
- a certification  
- a quality label or seal  

It makes no claim of correctness beyond the author’s own responsibility.

---

## Usage principles

Humangehalt follows two simple modes:

- **`H/`** — the concept or idea  
- **`H/xx`** — a concrete self-statement by the author  

Design-wise, the value is treated as a **small index**, visually subordinate to the mark.  
The notation should not be presented as a badge, score, or certification symbol.

## Trademark notice

**Humangehalt™** is a trademark claim by the author.  
It is used to identify the concept and its definition.
